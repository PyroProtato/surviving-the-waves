## Background
As a coder, I haven't had much experience outside my confort zone of python and pygame. This project is to change that. I branched out into a new coding language and learned the fundamentals of this new game engine! Overall I've really enjoyed it, and it really streamlines a lot of the basic elements like UI that I used to spend a long time on in pygame. Hopefully with this and other projects, I will be able to move into even more languages, frameworks, and engines and become a better coder.

## Credits
Most of the coding was done by me (PyroProtato). Special thanks to Icepenguin000 for creating an amazing player spritesheet and helping me stamp out a lot of the bugs in the game. My only use of AI in this project is to generate temporary assets (which I will eventually replace with human-made ones).
